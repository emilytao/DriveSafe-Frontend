# DriveSafe
According to the [government of canada](https://tc.canada.ca/en/road-transportation/motor-vehicle-safety/canadian-motor-vehicle-traffic-collision-statistics-2018), in 2018 alone, motor vehicle collisions were the cause of 152,847 injuries, 1,743 of which were fatal. DriveSafe is a database-reliant platform that acts to promote road safety, in hopes of lowering this number in the coming years.

2. Report a collision at an intersection
3. Visualize intersection data using Google Maps

## Data

2. [A public traffic volume dataset](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/intersection-traffic-movement-counts/table/)

## Tech Stack
DriveSafe is an **React** web application with a **Node.js** backend connected to a GCP Cloud SQL **MySQL** database.
